# What it is?
My entry to the 72 hour "Mini GameJam". The theme was "Ancient" and I was supposed to implement 'ailien language into the game'. What resulted is a puzzle game, where you are supposed to extract an ancient treassure from a spaceship. The only problem is, that the treasury room is filled guards. The only feasiable way to get around them is to memorize their language that gives you information about their upcoming movements.
